Upon receipt of <b>full payment</b>, the client is granted a <b>perpetual license</b> to use the work as explicitly outlined in the <b>invoice</b> or <b>contract</b>. Licenses may be <b>personal</b> (for private, non-commercial purposes) or <b>commercial</b> (for business, marketing, or promotional use), depending on the agreement.</h2>
                    <h2>Unless a separate <b>copyright transfer</b> or <b>exclusive buyout</b> has been explicitly negotiated and documented in writing, <b>D4VGFX Lab</b> retains the right to <b>display</b>, <b>promote</b>, <b>reuse</b>, and <b>showcase</b> the work in its <b>portfolio</b>, on <b>social media</b>, and for other <b>marketing purposes</b>.

An <b>order</b> is considered <b>confirmed</b> only after receipt of the agreed <b>deposit</b> (if applicable) or <b>full payment</b>, together with <b>approval</b> of the <b>project brief</b>. The client must provide a complete, accurate, and detailed <b>brief</b> including all necessary <b>assets</b>, <b>references</b>, and relevant <b>instructions</b>. Work will commence only after all <b>payment obligations</b> have been satisfied and the <b>brief</b> has been formally accepted.</h2>
                    <h2>All <b>quotes</b> or <b>project proposals</b> issued by <b>D4VGFX Lab</b> clearly define the <b>scope of work</b>, expected <b>deliverables</b>, <b>milestone deadlines</b>, and any required <b>deposit</b>.

                    <h2>The number of <b>included revisions</b> depends on the specific <b>variant</b> or package selected for the item; each variant clearly states how many revision rounds are provided. <b>Minor revisions</b> that fall within the original <b>scope</b> and within the included revision allowance will be implemented during the production phase. Once the client formally declares the job <b>finished</b>, <b>no further revisions</b> will be accepted.</h2>
                    <h2>If additional changes become necessary while the project is still in progress and the included revision allowance has been exceeded, the client may request <b>extra revisions</b> which will be treated as <b>out-of-scope</b> work and <b>charged separately</b> at the rates specified in the project <b>quote</b> or at a mutually agreed <b>hourly/flat rate</b>. <b>Major changes</b> that alter the original <b>brief</b>—such as introducing new concepts, changing the creative direction, or adding deliverables—are also considered <b>out-of-scope</b> and will incur additional fees as described above.</h2>

If a client <b>cancels</b> a project prior to completion, any work already completed will be charged proportionally, and the client will receive the corresponding <b>deliverables</b>.

For <b>interrupted projects</b>, partial refunds or partial deliverables are calculated based on <b>time invested</b>, <b>milestones completed</b>, and <b>resources allocated</b>. <b>D4VGFX Lab</b> may offer alternative solutions to ensure the client derives maximum <b>value</b> from payments, such as partial delivery, credit toward future projects, or project revision.</h2>

            <h3>At <b>D4VGFX Lab</b>, we believe in <b>crystal-clear communication</b> at every stage — <b>before and after</b> your purchase. Clear dialogue is the foundation of great results: it helps us understand your goals, reduces rework, and speeds up delivery. We keep the process transparent so you always know what to expect. Before you checkout, feel free to reach out through any channel that suits you: <b>email</b>, <b>Instagram DM</b>, or <b>WhatsApp</b>. Use these touchpoints to discuss your <b>vision</b>, <b>timeline</b>, and <b>budget</b> — even a short message is enough for us to give a meaningful, concrete response. The more context you share up front, the faster and more accurately we can scope your project.</h3>
            <h3>When you place an order via PayPal, please enter your <b>email address</b> in the <b>"More Information"</b> field on the payment page. This step is important: it lets us <b>follow up promptly</b> with any clarifying questions and ensures a smooth handover of files and instructions once the job is complete. You can submit orders <b>24/7</b>, but we process and reply during our official <b>Customer Support hours</b>: Mon–Wed & Fri: 10:00–17:00 and Thu: 10:00–12:00 (Closed Sat & Sun.) Requests received outside these hours will be addressed in the next available window — we aim for predictability and fast turnarounds.</h3>
            <h3>If <b>D4VGFX Lab</b> needs to take holiday time, we’ll announce it clearly with a <b>banner</b> placed immediately under the navigation bar. Any orders placed <b>during</b> or <b>immediately before</b> the holiday period will be <b>queued</b> and started again as soon as we return — no surprises, no hidden delays, and full transparency on expected timelines. For <b>fully custom requests</b> — from unique logo treatments to bespoke marketing packages — our team is always available via <b>email</b>, <b>Instagram chat</b>, or <b>WhatsApp</b>. We commit to replying to inquiries and quote requests within <b>24–48 hours</b>, providing clear scopes, timelines and revision windows so you can plan with confidence. At <b>D4VGFX Lab</b>, your <b>satisfaction</b> is our top priority: we combine responsive communication, documented handovers, and production-ready deliverables so your project is not only completed, but completed right.</h3>
