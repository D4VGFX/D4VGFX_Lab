                    <h2><b>Licenses</b> may be <b>personal</b> (for private, non-commercial purposes) or <b>commercial</b> (for business, marketing, or promotional use), depending on the <b>agreement</b>. This ensures that <b>clients</b> can enjoy legal and authorized use of the <b>creative works</b> while protecting the <b>intellectual property</b> rights of the studio.</h2>
                    <h2>Unless a separate <b>copyright transfer</b> or <b>exclusive buyout</b> has been explicitly negotiated and documented in writing, <b>D4VGFX Lab</b> retains the right to <b>display</b>, <b>promote</b>, <b>reuse</b>, and <b>showcase</b> the <b>work</b> in its <b>portfolio</b>, on <b>social media</b>, and for other <b>marketing purposes</b>. <b>Clients</b> are strictly prohibited from <b>reselling</b>, <b>relicensing</b>, <b>redistributing</b>, or <b>transferring</b> the <b>work</b> to any third party without explicit <b>written permission</b> from <b>D4VGFX Lab</b>.

At the time of <b>payment</b> through <b>PayPal</b>, the platform provides a <b>text field</b> which <b>cannot be left empty</b>; the <b>client</b> is required to enter all necessary <b>information</b> to ensure the <b>work</b> is executed effectively and achieves excellent results.</h2>
                    <h2>All <b>orders</b> are considered confirmed and <b>work</b> will commence <b>only upon receipt of payment</b> from the <b>client</b>. <b>D4VGFX Lab</b> will not begin any <b>project</b> before the <b>payment</b> has been received. To accelerate the process, the <b>client</b> is <b>required</b> to contact <b>D4VGFX Lab</b> using the <b>available communication channels</b> on the <b>website</b> — including <b>Instagram</b>, <b>WhatsApp</b>, or <b>email</b> — and attach the <b>payment receipt</b> along with all necessary <b>information</b> needed to complete the <b>final product</b>.</h2>
                    <h2>Regarding <b>quotes</b> or <b>project proposals</b>, clients must contact <b>D4VGFX Lab</b> directly.

                    <h2>The <b>number of revisions</b> included in a project depends on the <b>type of product</b> purchased by the <b>client</b>. Each product or package clearly indicates the <b>revision allowance</b>. Minor <b>revisions</b> that fall within the original <b>scope</b> of the project and within the included <b>revision allowance</b> will be implemented during the <b>production phase</b>.</h2>
                    <h2>If additional <b>revisions</b> are required beyond the included allowance, the <b>client</b> has both the <b>right</b> and the <b>obligation</b> to request them, provided they are <b>purchased separately</b> before the completion of the <b>work</b>. Once the <b>project</b> is formally declared <b>finished</b> by the <b>client</b> or <b>D4VGFX Lab</b>, no further <b>revisions</b> or <b>modifications</b> will be accepted under any circumstances.</h2>
                    <h2>Any <b>major changes</b> — such as significant alterations to the original <b>brief</b>, complete rework of the <b>project</b>, or addition of new <b>deliverables</b> — are considered <b>out-of-scope</b>. In such cases, the <b>client</b> is not only <b>entitled</b> but also <b>required</b> to pay an <b>extra fee</b> as specified in the <b>quote</b> or by mutual agreement. This ensures that both <b>D4VGFX Lab</b> and the <b>client</b> maintain clear expectations and fair <b>compensation</b> for additional work.</h2>

If the <b>client</b> requests the <b>raw files</b> — such as <b>Adobe Illustrator (.AI)</b> or <b>Photoshop (.PSD)</b> — they are <b>required</b> and <b>obligated</b> to pay an <b>additional fee</b> to obtain these <b>source files</b>, unless explicitly included in the purchased <b>package</b> or <b>service</b>.</h2>
                    <h2><b>Delivery times</b> vary depending on the <b>item purchased</b>, the <b>complexity</b> of the project, the <b>number of revision cycles</b>, any <b>modifications to the project scope</b>, and the <b>response times</b> between the <b>client</b> and <b>D4VGFX Lab</b>. For any eventuality, <b>D4VGFX Lab</b> is <b>required</b> and <b>obligated</b> to notify the <b>client</b>, who <b>has the right</b> to receive such notifications regarding changes, delays, or important project updates.</h2>

If a <b>client</b> chooses to cancel a <b>project</b> prior to completion, any <b>work</b> that has already been completed will be <b>charged proportionally</b>, and the <b>client</b> will receive the corresponding <b>deliverables</b> that have been produced up to that point.</h2>
                    <h2>In the event that <b>D4VGFX Lab</b> cancels a <b>project</b> or is unable to deliver the <b>agreed services</b>, the <b>client</b> will receive a <b>refund</b> for the <b>undelivered portion</b> of the project. It is important to note that if the <b>payment</b> was made via <b>PayPal</b>, the <b>platform fees/commissions</b> retained by PayPal cannot be refunded, meaning the <b>client</b> will receive the full <b>amount paid</b> minus any <b>PayPal transaction fees</b>. Therefore, a <b>100% net refund</b> is not always possible due to these <b>third-party fees</b>.</h2>
                    <h2>For <b>interrupted projects</b>, <b>partial refunds</b> or <b>partial deliverables</b> are calculated based on the <b>time invested</b>, <b>milestones completed</b>, and <b>resources allocated</b>. All refund calculations will always be <b>transparent</b> and clearly communicated to the <b>client</b> to maintain <b>professional trust</b> and fairness. Cancellations and refunds are handled promptly and in accordance with these <b>Terms & Conditions</b>, ensuring both <b>D4VGFX Lab</b> and the <b>client</b> have a clear understanding of obligations and outcomes.</h2>

                    <h2>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the <b>liability</b> of <b>D4VGFX Lab</b> is strictly limited to the <b>fees paid</b> for the <b>project</b> in question.
