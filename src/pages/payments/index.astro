            <h3>At <b>D4VGFX Lab</b>, we believe in <b>crystal-clear communication</b> at every stage — <b>before and after</b> your purchase. Clear dialogue is the foundation of great results: it helps us understand your goals, reduces rework, and speeds up delivery. We keep the process transparent so you always know what to expect. Before you checkout, feel free to reach out through any channel that suits you: <b>email</b>, <b>Instagram DM</b>, or <b>WhatsApp</b>. Use these touchpoints to discuss your <b>vision</b>, <b>timeline</b>, and <b>budget</b> — even a short message is enough for us to give a meaningful, concrete response. The more context you share up front, the faster and more accurately we can scope your project.</h3>
            <h3>When you place an order via PayPal, please enter your <b>email address</b> in the <b>"More Information"</b> field on the payment page. This step is important: it lets us <b>follow up promptly</b> with any clarifying questions and ensures a smooth handover of files and instructions once the job is complete. You can submit orders <b>24/7</b>, but we process and reply during our official <b>Customer Support hours</b>: Mon–Wed & Fri: 10:00–17:00 and Thu: 10:00–12:00 (Closed Sat & Sun.) Requests received outside these hours will be addressed in the next available window — we aim for predictability and fast turnarounds.</h3>
            <h3>If <b>D4VGFX Lab</b> needs to take holiday time, we’ll announce it clearly with a <b>banner</b> placed immediately under the navigation bar. Any orders placed <b>during</b> or <b>immediately before</b> the holiday period will be <b>queued</b> and started again as soon as we return — no surprises, no hidden delays, and full transparency on expected timelines. For <b>fully custom requests</b> — from unique logo treatments to bespoke marketing packages — our team is always available via <b>email</b>, <b>Instagram chat</b>, or <b>WhatsApp</b>. We commit to replying to inquiries and quote requests within <b>24–48 hours</b>, providing clear scopes, timelines and revision windows so you can plan with confidence. At <b>D4VGFX Lab</b>, your <b>satisfaction</b> is our top priority: we combine responsive communication, documented handovers, and production-ready deliverables so your project is not only completed, but completed right.</h3>
